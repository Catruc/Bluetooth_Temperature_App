Bluetooth Temperature App


Introduction

The Bluetooth Temperature App is a cutting-edge solution designed to monitor and display temperature readings in real-time. This project encompasses a VHDL application that interfaces with a temperature sensor on a Nexys 4 board, transmitting data continuously to an Android app. The Android application presents the temperature data to the user in either Celsius or Fahrenheit. Utilizing Bluetooth connectivity, it establishes a seamless link with paired devices, tested and proven with the HC-05 module, ensuring reliable and instantaneous temperature monitoring.

Features
